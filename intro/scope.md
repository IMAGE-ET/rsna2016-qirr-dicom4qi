# Scope
The declared scope of the exhibit covered exchange of the following types of data:
* DICOM Segmentation image object (SEG), representing a classification of pixels in one or more referenced images. Among other capabilities, SEG provides unambiguous specification of the anatomy being segmented using structured terminology.
* DICOM Parametric Map object (PM) can be used to encode floating-point pixel maps of derived parameters, such as results of pharmacokinetic analysis of Dynamic Contrast-Enhanced MRI.
* DICOM Structured reporting of measurements using SR template 1500 (SR-TID1500) can be used to communicate measurements over the image region defined by, for example, a SEG object.
