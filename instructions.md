# Instructions for participants
The overall idea of the activity is to demonstrate interchange of the types of DICOM objects needed for quantitative imaging research.

As such, we aim to test the capabilities of the individual platforms to consume and produce the types of DICOM objects in question.

For each type of DICOM object, we provide sample datasets that include imaging series and the derived DICOM dataset of the type in question. Each participant is asked to complete 2 tasks:

1. **Read task**: Demonstrate how the provided test dataset is consumed and presented to the platform user. In this task we aim to evaluate both the accuracy of interpreting the specific test dataset, and the end-user usability.

2. **Write task**: Generate a dataset of the type in question. The dataset will be used to test interoperability of your platform with the other platforms participating in the connectathon.

Your submission **must** include the details about the platform you used to generate the results (name of the product/platform, version). If your platform is available publicly, please include access instructions.

__If your platform and usage instructions are publicly available, you have the option to just send those to Andrey Fedorov, and he can do all the testing and populate the document content with the results.__

The details for the individual object types follow in the subsequent sections.
