# Introduction

In 2015, [Andrey Fedorov](http://fedorov.github.io) and [Daniel Rubin](https://med.stanford.edu/profiles/daniel-rubin) came up with an idea of a collaborative project with the goal of testing and improving [DICOM](http://dicom.nema.org/Dicom/about-DICOM.html) interoperability for communicating quantitative image analysis results (so called, "DICOM-QI connectathon"). This led to a Quantitative Imaging Reading Room (QIRR) exhibit at the annual convention of the [Radiological Society of North America (RSNA)](http://rsna.org) in 2015. The goal of that exhibit was to demonstrate DICOM-based communication of the image segmentation results. You can see the summary of the exhibit results in [this poster](https://dx.doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.1619877.v1).

The present document was created to help with the organization of the connectathon activity, and as such serves two purposes:
* First, this is the place to develop and document operating procedures, expectations and organize test datasets.
* Second, this document will be used to report the connectathon results.
