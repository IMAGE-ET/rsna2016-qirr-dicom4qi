# Introduction

In 2015, [Andrey Fedorov](http://fedorov.github.io) and [Daniel Rubin](https://med.stanford.edu/profiles/daniel-rubin) came up with an idea of a collaborative project with the goal of testing and improving [DICOM](http://dicom.nema.org/Dicom/about-DICOM.html) interoperability for communicating [quantitative image analysis results](https://peerj.com/articles/2057/) (so called, "DICOM-QI connectathon"). This led to a Quantitative Imaging Reading Room (QIRR) exhibit at the annual convention of the [Radiological Society of North America (RSNA)](http://rsna.org) in 2015. The goal of that exhibit was to demonstrate DICOM-based communication of the image segmentation results. You can see the summary of the exhibit results in [this poster](https://dx.doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.1619877.v1).

In 2016, a larger group assembled aiming to continue and expand the scope of the original 2015 RSNA/QIRR DICOM for Quantitative Imaging (DICOM4QI) connectathon. Following successful application for participation, RSNA 2016 QIRR will feature the new iteration of the connectathon.

The present document was created to help with the organization of the exhibit activity, and as such serves two purposes:
* First, this is the place to develop and document operating procedures, expectations and organize test datasets.
* Second, this document will be used to report the connectathon results.
